# Project 3 Depth Estimation

In this project, we are going to implement the concept of Stereo Vision. We will be
given 3 different datasets, each of them contains 2 images of the same scenario but
taken from two different camera angles. By comparing the information about a
scene from 2 vantage points, we can obtain the 3D information by examining the
relative positions of objects.
